    """Construct a example vgg 11-layers version network.

    Note: All the fully_connected layers have been transformed to conv2d layers.
        To use in classification mode, resize input to 224x224.

    Args:
    inputs: a tensor of size [batch_size, height, width, channels].
    num_classes: number of predicted classes. If 0 or None, the logits layer is
      omitted and the input features to the logits layer are returned instead.
    is_training: whether or not the model is being trained.
    dropout_keep_prob: the probability that activations are kept in the dropout
      layers during training.
    spatial_squeeze: whether or not should squeeze the spatial dimensions of the
      outputs. Useful to remove unnecessary dimensions for classification.
    scope: Optional scope for the variables.
    fc_conv_padding: the type of padding to use for the fully connected layer
      that is implemented as a convolutional layer. Use 'SAME' padding if you
      are applying the network in a fully convolutional manner and want to
      get a prediction map downsampled by a factor of 32 as an output.
      Otherwise, the output prediction map will be (input / 32) - 6 in case of
      'VALID' padding.
    global_pool: Optional boolean flag. If True, the input to the classification
      layer is avgpooled to size 1x1, for any input size. (This is not part
      of the original VGG architecture.)

    Returns
    -------
    net: the output of the logits layer (if num_classes is a non-zero integer),
      or the input to the logits layer (if num_classes is 0 or None).
    end_points: a dict of tensors with intermediate activations.
